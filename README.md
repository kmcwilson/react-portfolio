## Future Development
* For future development of this application, I would like to use backend to store my information for my projects. This would be done using `MongoDB` and `GraphQL`. 
* I would like to make the application more dynamic with `Bootstrap` and `CSS3`
* Finally, I would like to have the contact section be functional and directly email me
